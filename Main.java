	 For this project I am intending on making a GUI based software that will be able to modify and preview JFrame, and elements by
	 modifying it. After it is modified I will create a file and put the code in that file, once I have done that I will find a way
	 to preview that.
	 
	 For this project I intend to comment more code also in order to get better at it.
	 
	 Things to do:
	 Add basic menu and sliders
	 Find way to preview the features with real update: thinking a button action event and make a new JFrame
	 Find way to send the code to file, will include stuff that can't be changed
